# Add a New Eval

Follow these steps whenever the user asks to create a new eval. Read `.cursor/skills/add-eval/reference.md` for grader helpers, test patterns, and conventions.

**Switch to Plan mode immediately.** Steps 0-2 (gather info, research, design) are collaborative and read-only. The user should see the research findings and approve the eval design before any files are created. Switch back to Agent mode at Step 3.

## Step 0: Gather Information

Determine the following (ask the user if not provided):

1. **Concept to test** - what Convex feature or pattern should this eval exercise? (e.g. "vector search", "pagination with joins", "cascade deletes")
2. **Specific focus** - any edge cases, constraints, or behaviors the user wants to emphasize?

### Category Selection

List the existing categories by scanning `evals/` top-level directories, then propose the best-fit category. The current categories are:

| Category | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `000-fundamentals` | Basic Convex concepts (empty functions, schema definition, crons, scheduling) |
| `001-data_modeling` | Schema design, indexes, relationships, unions, optional fields |
| `002-queries` | Reading data, joins, pagination, aggregation, filtering |
| `003-mutations` | Writing data, inserts, patches, deletes, cascades |
| `004-actions` | HTTP fetch, file storage, node runtime, HTTP action routing |
| `005-idioms` | File organization, internal functions, batch patterns |
| `006-clients` | useQuery, useMutation, usePaginatedQuery |

- If the concept **clearly fits** one category, propose it with a brief justification.
- If it's **ambiguous** (e.g. "scheduled mutations" could be fundamentals or mutations), stop and ask the user. Present the candidate categories with reasoning for each.
- If it **doesn't fit** any existing category, propose creating a new category and ask the user to confirm.

Determine the eval number by listing existing evals in the chosen category and picking the next sequential number.

## Step 1: Research

Run these four research tracks. Use sub-agents or parallel tool calls where possible.

### A. Convex Docs (source of truth)

1. Fetch `https://docs.convex.dev/llms.txt` to get the docs table of contents.
2. Identify the 1-3 most relevant doc pages for the concept being tested.
3. Use WebFetch to retrieve those specific pages.
4. Extract the correct API patterns, constraints, and best practices. These are ground truth for designing the eval and answer.

### B. Existing Guidelines

1. Read the relevant sections of `runner/models/guidelines.ts` (or the generated guidelines) for the concept being tested.
2. Record:
   - Which existing guidelines are relevant
   - What behavior those guidelines would lead a model to produce
   - Whether the current guidelines would already be expected to make strong models pass
   - Whether any guideline seems to conflict with what the proposed eval is trying to reward
3. Do **not** treat this as a reason to block the eval automatically. This is context for design and later calibration.
4. If an existing guideline appears to directly contradict the proposed eval, **STOP and discuss with the user** before proceeding.

### C. Existing Eval Patterns

1. Read 2-3 evals in the same or a similar category.
2. Study: TASK.txt style, answer structure, test approach, schema design.
3. Note which grader helpers and test patterns they use. See `reference.md` for the full catalog.

### D. Overlap Check

1. List ALL eval directory names under `evals/` to get a high-level view of coverage.
2. For any eval whose name suggests overlap with the proposed concept, read its TASK.txt.
3. If an existing eval tests the **same or very similar** concept, **STOP and warn the user**:
   - Name the overlapping eval(s) and explain what they already cover.
   - Ask whether to: differentiate the new eval (narrow its scope), adjust the existing eval, or abandon.
4. Flag even **partial overlap**, e.g. "002-queries/012-index_and_filter already tests index usage but doesn't cover compound indexes."

## Step 2: Design the Eval

You should already be in Plan mode. Present the full eval design to the user for review.

### TASK.txt Draft

Write the complete TASK.txt content. Follow these principles:

- **Laser-focused** on the concept being tested. Control other variables (keep schema simple, minimize unrelated code).
- **Explicit** about schema, function names, argument types, return shapes, and which files to create.
- **Don't over-specify** Convex implementation details that are covered by the guidelines. If a model needs the task to spell out how to use `internalMutation` or how pagination works, that's a meaningful signal, not a task problem.
- **Don't under-specify** the problem domain. The model should not need to guess what the feature does, only how to implement it in Convex.
- **Include schema** as a TypeScript code block when applicable.
- **Specify edge cases** (empty results, error messages, missing data).

### Answer Outline

Describe the files that will be created and the key implementation approach. Don't write the full code yet, just the structure and important decisions.

### Test Approach

Describe how the eval will be graded:

- Pick the primary grading primitive first: behavior tests, schema inspection, function-spec comparison, HTTP testing, AI grading, AST analysis, or some combination.
- Which grader helpers to use (see `reference.md` for the catalog and decision tree).
- What behaviors to assert on.
- Whether standard unit tests are sufficient, or if you need schema inspection, HTTP testing, AI grading, or something else.

**If unit tests cannot fully verify the concept** (e.g. testing that a model uses an index rather than a filter, or testing code organization patterns), **STOP and discuss with the user.** Present the options:

- Schema/index inspection (using `getSchema`, `hasIndexForFields`)
- AI grading (`createAIGraderTest`, currently disabled and requires a repo change to re-enable)
- AST analysis (parse the generated TypeScript files)
- Restructure the eval so the concept can be tested via behavior
- Accept the limitation and test what we can

Let the user decide before proceeding.

### Guidelines Hypothesis

Summarize the guideline context before implementation:

- Which existing guidelines are relevant to this eval
- What you would expect guideline-following models to do
- Whether failures on this eval would likely indicate a model gap, an eval/task problem, or a missing/weak guideline
- Any existing guideline that might need to be revised if calibration shows an unexpected result

### Push Back

Before presenting the design, critically evaluate it. Warn the user if:

- The eval overlaps heavily with an existing eval (should have been caught in Step 1C, but re-check).
- The task tests too many concepts at once. Each eval should focus on one thing.
- The task is so explicit that it tells the model exactly how to solve it (e.g. specifying `.withIndex()` calls). We're testing knowledge, not instruction-following.
- The current guidelines suggest a different approach than the eval is rewarding, or make the expected signal unclear.
- The eval seems too easy (every model will pass) or too hard (no model will pass).

## Step 3: Implement the Eval

After the user approves the design, **switch back to Agent mode** and implement:

1. **Create directory:** `evals/<category>/<eval_slug>/`

2. **Write TASK.txt** with the approved content.

3. **Create answer directory:**
   - `answer/package.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "convexbot",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "dependencies": {
         "convex": "^1.31.2"
       }
     }
     ```
   - `answer/convex/schema.ts` (if applicable)
   - Implementation files (e.g. `answer/convex/index.ts`)

4. **Run codegen:**
   ```bash
   cd evals/<category>/<eval_slug>/answer && bunx convex codegen
   ```

5. **Write grader.test.ts** using the approved test approach. Import paths are relative:
   ```typescript
   import { responseClient, responseAdminClient, addDocuments } from "../../../grader";
   import { api } from "./answer/convex/_generated/api";
   ```
   Adjust the depth of `../` based on the eval's nesting level.

6. **Typecheck:**
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   ```

## Step 4: Validate the Answer

First run canonical answer validation for the new eval:

```bash
TEST_FILTER=<category>/<eval_slug> bun run validate:answers
```

Then run the eval for one model as a smoke test. This validates model generation against the new eval:

```bash
MODELS=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 TEST_FILTER=<category>/<eval_slug> bun run local:run
```

Do NOT set `CONVEX_EVAL_URL` or `CONVEX_AUTH_TOKEN`, so results stay local-only.

If the smoke test fails:

1. Read the output directory and `run.log` to understand what happened.
2. Determine whether it's a **test problem** (fix the grader) or a **model problem** (expected, move on).
3. If the test itself is broken, fix it and re-run before proceeding.

## Step 5: Run Against Multiple Models

Start with a smaller representative set of models to calibrate difficulty. If the result is unclear, expand to a broader sweep. Launch separate background processes, one per model:

```bash
# Suggested first-pass set
MODELS=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 TEST_FILTER=<category>/<eval_slug> bun run local:run &
MODELS=openai/gpt-5.4 TEST_FILTER=<category>/<eval_slug> bun run local:run &
MODELS=google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview TEST_FILTER=<category>/<eval_slug> bun run local:run &
MODELS=anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 TEST_FILTER=<category>/<eval_slug> bun run local:run &
wait
```

If those results are too noisy or too uniform, expand to a broader sweep across providers and tiers. The user can override the list. Do NOT set `CONVEX_EVAL_URL` or `CONVEX_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Monitor the background processes by reading their terminal output files. Each process runs one eval so they should complete in a few minutes.

## Step 6: Review Results and Calibrate

Collect pass/fail from all model runs and present a summary table:

```
Model                          Result
-----------------------------  ------
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6    PASS
anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5     FAIL
openai/gpt-5.4                 PASS
...
```

Then assess the results:

- **All pass** - The eval is likely too easy or the task is too explicit. Recommend tightening the task (remove implementation hints) or adding harder edge cases.
- **All fail** - The eval might be too hard, poorly specified, or testing something not covered by the guidelines. Investigate the failures. Common causes: ambiguous requirements, missing context, concept beyond current model capabilities.
- **Mixed results (ideal)** - The eval discriminates between model capabilities. Note whether the pass/fail pattern makes sense given model tiers.
- **Unexpected pattern** (e.g. only one provider's models fail) - Might indicate a provider-specific quirk rather than a meaningful eval. Investigate before keeping.

Then explicitly ask: is this primarily an **eval/task gap**, a **model gap**, or a **guideline gap**?

- **Eval/task gap** - The task is ambiguous, over-specified, under-specified, or the grader is not testing the right thing. Fix the eval first.
- **Model gap** - The task is sound, the grading is sound, and failures are what we would expect. Keep the eval.
- **Guideline gap** - The failures suggest there should be a guideline that helps here, or an existing guideline is weak/confusing/contradictory. Recommend following up with the `validate-guidelines` skill after the eval is settled.

**Push back** with specific recommendations if calibration looks off. Suggest concrete changes to the task, answer, or tests.
