- See package.json to work out how to run the models
- Model definitions are stored in /runner/models/index.ts
- Curated models run periodically via GitHub Actions, but only while the Periodic Evaluations workflow is enabled (`gh workflow list --all`)
- When adding a new model, follow `.cursor/skills/add-model/SKILL.md`, which includes running it against one or two evals to make sure it works
- This project uses bun extensively, including for its package manager and running tests and scripts
- You should look at the package.json for the scripts you can use
- You should `bun run typecheck` regularly to ensure that any changes have not broken the types
- Run `bun run test` to run all test suites (runner unit tests + evalScores backend tests). Do this after making changes to the runner or evalScores backend.

## Web experiment direction

`no_guidelines_with_web` is the sole web experiment, using client-owned Exa
search and page-fetch tools. Set `CLIENT_WEB_TOOLS=1`; eval runs cannot use the
historical unfiltered server-tool path. Both `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY`
are required. See `docs/web-source-filtering.md` for benchmark-source protections
and limits, and `docs/client-web-rollout.md` for release gates. Use
`DISABLE_CONVEX_REPORTING=1` for local validation.
The earlier provider-search and native coding-harness experiments are retired;
do not resume them from old handoffs. Historical experiment literals in the
backend are storage compatibility only.

## API Keys & Environment

All API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) are stored in the root `.env` file and loaded automatically via `dotenv`. You do not need to set them manually — they are already configured for local development.

## Running Evals Locally

Use environment variables `MODELS` and `TEST_FILTER` with `bun run local:run`. `MODELS` takes OpenRouter slugs. A bare name like `gpt-5` fails discovery and the runner exits.

```bash
# Run a single eval for a specific model:
MODELS=openai/gpt-5.2-codex TEST_FILTER=000-fundamentals/003 bun run local:run

# Run all fundamentals for a model:
MODELS=openai/gpt-5.2-codex TEST_FILTER=000-fundamentals bun run local:run

# Run multiple specific evals (TEST_FILTER is a regex):
MODELS=openai/gpt-5.2-codex TEST_FILTER="003-crons|012-index_and_filter|000-use_query" bun run local:run

# Run with a different experiment:
EVALS_EXPERIMENT=no_guidelines MODELS=openai/gpt-5 TEST_FILTER=000-fundamentals/000 bun run local:run
```

The `local:run` script is just `bun run runner/index.ts`. The convenience aliases `local:run:fundamentals` and `local:run:one` in package.json show the pattern.

The interactive `bun run evals` script provides a menu-driven way to select models and evals.

## Convex Deployments

[text](https://www.convex.dev/llm-leaderboard/with-guidelines)
The evalScores backend has two Convex deployments:

- **Production**: `https://fabulous-panther-525.convex.cloud` — used by CI/GitHub Actions. The GitHub secret `CONVEX_EVAL_URL` must point to this URL.
- **Development**: `https://brazen-pelican-414.convex.cloud` — used for local development (`bun run dev` in evalScores/).

Codex worktree setup runs `.codex/environments/setup.mjs`, which installs dependencies and creates ignored `.env.local` files pointing `evalScores` and the visualizer at the development deployment. For existing worktrees or manual repair, run `bun run setup:convex`. `bun run dev` also runs this setup automatically.

The Convex LLM leaderboard (https://www.convex.dev/llm-leaderboard/) uses the dat from the production version of this convex deployment.

The runner communicates with the Convex backend via `ConvexClient` using the public mutations/queries in `evalScores/convex/admin.ts`. Authentication is done via a bearer token passed as an argument to each function (validated against the `authTokens` table). The GitHub secret `CONVEX_AUTH_TOKEN` holds this token for CI.

When deploying changes to the evalScores backend, use `npx convex deploy` from the `evalScores/` directory (handled automatically by the release workflow). Do NOT deploy local dev changes to production accidentally.

## Deployment & Migration Workflow

### Schema Change Approval Gate

Before making any Convex schema change, show the user the proposed schema diff
and explain its migration and deployment implications. Wait for the user's
explicit approval before editing `evalScores/convex/schema.ts`, adding a schema
migration, or deploying the schema change to any Convex deployment.

When making schema or data changes to the Convex backend that require migrations:

1. **Never deploy directly to production** from your local dev environment.
2. **Commit and push to `main`** to trigger the `release.yml` workflow, which auto-deploys the Convex backend to production.
3. **Monitor the deploy** via: `gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit=1 --watch`
4. **After the deploy completes**, run any pending migrations via the CLI:
   ```bash
   cd evalScores && npx convex run migrations:runAll --prod
   ```
5. **Monitor migration progress**:
   ```bash
   npx convex run --component migrations lib:getStatus --watch --prod
   ```
6. **If the migration enables further schema tightening** (e.g. making optional fields required, removing deprecated tables), make those changes in a **second commit** and push again to deploy the tightened schema.

`migrations:runAll` currently includes the run benchmark-version ID backfill.
Seed the reconstructed benchmark documents with
`benchmarkVersions:seedHistorical` before running it. Do not tighten the schema
until `migrations:auditBenchmarkVersionBackfill` reports zero unresolved runs
and the derived `modelScores` rows have been rebuilt.

The general pattern is: deploy code first (with loose/compatible schema), run data migrations if needed, then deploy tightened schema.

## Benchmark Version Minting

Benchmark versions are minted manually, never automatically as part of a
release. When a batch of eval additions or meaningful eval changes appears to
be complete, tell the user that it is probably a good time to mint a new
benchmark version. If the user expects more eval work over the next few days,
offer to schedule a follow-up task to revisit minting after that work is done.

Do not mint or publish a benchmark version without the user's explicit
approval. Minting is metadata-only and must not trigger paid model runs; the
normal periodic schedule populates the new version over time.

Local eval runs must never write to the production Convex deployment. Local
runs may report only to the development deployment. Production eval reporting
is reserved for GitHub Actions running on `main`.

## Deleting a Run

To delete a run from the production Convex deployment (e.g. if it was corrupted by rate-limit errors), use the `deleteRun` internal mutation. This cascade-deletes all evals, steps, and output storage files associated with the run, and decrements the experiment stats.

```bash
cd evalScores && npx convex run runs:deleteRun --prod '{"runId": "<convex_document_id>"}'
```

The `runId` is the Convex document `_id` for the run, which appears in the runner output as `Completed run <id>`. You can also find run IDs via the Convex dashboard or the visualiser.

**Note:** Eval source files are intentionally preserved since they are deduped/shared across runs.

## Run Analysis Reports

The `reports/` directory contains post-run analysis reports organised by provider and model:

```
reports/{provider}/{model}/{run-id-prefix}_{date}.md
```

For example: `reports/anthropic/claude-opus-4-6/jn72t14a_2026-02-06.md`

Each report contains:

- Per-failure classification (model fault, overly strict testing, ambiguous task, known gap)
- Cross-cutting patterns across failures
- Actions taken (lint config changes, grader fixes, task updates)
- Net impact assessment

When investigating a model's performance or deciding whether to adjust eval requirements, check the reports directory for prior analyses of the same model or similar failure patterns.

## Authoring New Evals

Conventions established during the 2026-07 eval-roadmap work (waves tracked in GitHub issues):

- When a guideline recommends a component, describe its capability SHAPE (e.g. aggregates: counts/sums/ranks/offsets over many rows), never the eval's application domain - a guideline mentioning "leaderboard" is overfit to the eval that motivated it. Generalize or enumerate use-cases; then rerun the ablation to prove the generalized wording still lands.
- In guidelines, prefer concrete instances over placeholder syntax: `components.myName.index.myFunction` landed where `components.<name>.<module>.<function>` did not (verified by model runs).
- When investigating what models actually do (component choice, pattern use), run BOTH conditions: default and `EVALS_EXPERIMENT=no_guidelines`. The delta is the guideline's measured contribution; identical behavior in both conditions means the guideline line is not earning its tokens.
- Coverage standard per covered component: at least 3 selection scenarios (distinct capability shapes/domains) and at least 1 usage eval (API docs in task, full pipeline).
- SELECTION evals use the static pipeline: ship an `eval.json` with `{ "pipeline": "static" }` and a grader that only parses the generated files (import from `grader/outputDir`, not `grader/index` - no backend env exists). This grades what the model CHOSE, deliberately tolerant of syntax errors and stale versions; the paired usage eval grades correctness with full pipeline + docs in its task.
- Component-specific API reference (constructor options, method signatures) never goes in the global guidelines - it goes in the eval's TASK.txt as a minimal reference excerpt, simulating an agent that fetched the component's docs. Guidelines carry only generic platform knowledge (mounting, local-component authoring, subtransaction semantics).
- Guidelines are paid for twice: they steer graded models here AND get pulled into every user's project context. Add a guideline line ONLY when it demonstrably helps models pass a specific eval (use `ablation:generate`/`ablation:run` to prove it), keep it as terse as possible, and prefer improving an existing line over adding a new one. Never add guidelines speculatively.
- Component evals come in two kinds: USAGE evals name the component and test correct wiring (pin exact versions); SELECTION evals state only the product requirement and test that the model chooses the component over hand-rolling (no version pins possible - grade version-agnostically via behavior and scan bans).
- Every eval issue and PR must include a "Why this matters" section: what Convex-specific knowledge is being measured and what silently breaks in production when a model lacks it. If you cannot articulate the why, the eval is probably testing trivia.
- One concept per eval. If a task needs auth AND concurrency AND error shapes, split it - see the README's eval-writing rules.
- Do NOT put `returns:` validators in reference answers unless the task explicitly tests them (only `000-fundamentals/009-returns_validator` and `002-queries/018-pagination_returns_validator`). Answers are likely training data and the guidelines deliberately mandate only argument validators.
- Graders must be returns-neutral: use `compareFunctionSpec(skip, { ignoreReturns: true })`, plus `publicOnly: true` when the task does not dictate internal function names/modules.
- Never use fixed sleeps for scheduled work in graders - use `pollUntil` from `grader/pollUntil.ts`, and give slow poll-based tests explicit vitest timeouts (the scorer's vitest budget must exceed the summed per-test timeouts of the slowest grader; see `runner/scorer.ts` TIMEOUTS).
- AST/source checks must be precise: tie checks to the consumed call chain (not "identifier appears somewhere"), resolve named constants anywhere in the file, and scope wall-clock/scan bans to what the task actually forbids. Behavioral tests should defeat cheats where possible (multi-cutoff, crowd-out, inverted-input patterns) before reaching for AST checks.
- `bunx convex codegen` fails without a deployment; to produce `answer/convex/_generated`, copy it from a sibling single-module eval (they are module-name-generic) or run `bun run generate:answer-types`. The scorer regenerates during deployment anyway.
- Validate any touched eval against a real local backend before pushing: `TEST_FILTER='<eval-name-regex>' bun run scripts/validateAnswers.ts` must report 100%.
- Each answer's `package.json` pins its own deps (the root lockfile does not constrain generated projects); pin exact versions for component evals.
