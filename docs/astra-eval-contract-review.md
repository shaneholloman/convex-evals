> **Current review status:** the previous platform-grader readiness statement was withdrawn after independent review. The active correction replaces the shared QuickJS execution runtime, separates grader infrastructure errors from model scores, and clarifies task contracts.

# Astra eval task-contract review

2026-09-08 review of the 14 recurring `no_guidelines` failures and the adjacent
`006-typed_env` task. The tables below record the findings at review time.

2026-09-09 follow-up: the nested-limit correction is implemented and validated,
including the native-call task clarification and execution-based grading. See
[its validation report](../reports/openai/gpt-6-astra/local_nested_transaction_limits_2026-09-08.md).
The typed application env correction is also implemented and validated;
see [its validation report](../reports/openai/gpt-6-astra/local_typed_env_2026-09-09.md).
The platform URL env correction is implemented locally for review;
see [its validation report](../reports/openai/gpt-6-astra/local_platform_env_urls_2026-09-09.md).
The follow-up now also contains a drafted time-window clarification and shared
runtime/scoring corrections. The dated tables below preserve the original audit;
the [current decision record](query-probe-review.md) tracks the corrected state.
Historical results and benchmark versions are unchanged.

## Conclusion

The recurring failures have several causes that must be assessed independently:
unclear task requirements, invalid generated implementations, graders that
recognize syntax rather than the relevant operation, incomplete runtime probes,
and scores whose meaning is narrower than application correctness.

The native-validator and heartbeat work already made their requested capability
explicit. The original nested-limit shorthand fix addressed a real false
negative but was insufficient: an unused native-limit example could fool the
same checker. The correction replaces that checker with observation
of the executed child call and retains the real-backend rollback tests.

The revised authoring guidance in [README.md](../README.md#writing-evals) replaces
the rule that guideline coverage alone establishes model fault. API knowledge
can legitimately be tested without supplying its documentation. That does not
remove the need to justify the graded requirement, distinguish alternative
valid implementations, or state what the resulting score establishes.

## Claims and decisions

Each row records the original audit claim and decision. "Keep" means the contract is defensible with the
stated evidence and limits, not that every possible grader path has been proven.
The component rows are a contract and interpretation review, not a new audit of
every branch in their static analyzers.

The typed-env fake illustrates why the earlier 2/3 pass rate on the related task
cannot, by itself, prove Astra used the real typed API. Generated answers and
their behavior must be inspected before interpreting that apparent contrast.

## Proposed task clarifications

The nested-limit clarification has been applied. The time-window clarification
was applied to `TASK.txt` in #306. The cascade-delete wording
remains a proposal; that task has not been edited in this batch.

### Time-window query

Recommended addition, retaining freedom to name the time argument:

> The caller supplies a Unix timestamp in milliseconds. Return the active items
> as of that timestamp, including when it is in the past or future. Do not read
> the wall clock while evaluating this query.

This makes caller-controlled time part of the contract. It measures correct
implementation of that requested property, not spontaneous selection of a
reactive time-update strategy. If spontaneous strategy selection is the intended
goal instead, use a separate product scenario with observable freshness and
allowed alternatives rather than silently grading this narrower query as one.

### Cascade delete

To preserve the current grader's intended missing-user behavior, add:

> If the user does not exist, throw an error and leave all stored data unchanged.
> The error message is not prescribed.

Idempotent deletion is also a reasonable product choice, but would require a
different explicit contract. "Proper error handling" does not decide between
them. Add fixtures for comments and likes authored by the deleted user on another
user's surviving post, alongside other users' records that must remain.

The current reference loads dependent records with `collect()`. This eval should
make no claim about deletion of an unbounded account history; that needs the
separate batching/completion coverage already requested. Making a single
transaction delete arbitrarily many rows would be an incompatible requirement.

### Nested mutation limit

Clarify the existing phrase "limiting the nested call" as:

> Apply Convex's native per-call document-write limit to the nested mutation.
> The child itself must still insert the requested count when called directly.

Do not name `transactionLimits` or `documentsWritten` if recalling the API is
part of this task's claim. This clarification alone does not fix the grader;
the real invoked child must carry the budget.

### Bounded listing

The earlier approved decision deliberately retained a neutral task to measure
the default choice. Preserve that decision and describe the score accordingly.
Do not quietly turn it into an explicitly prompted usage task.

If the desired claim changes to functional bounded listing, a suitable separate
contract would say "return one finite batch from a workspace whose audit history
can keep growing." If it changes to complete browsing, specify a continuation
path and exercise every page. A fixed `take(n)` is not complete pagination.

| Typed application env | Aliased/namespace imports, destructuring, helpers, equivalent validators and fallback expressions. | Fake local `env`, hardcoded defaults, raw `process.env` where forbidden, wrong union/optionality, stale values after updates.                           | Generated type metadata; unset/set/change/unset values through the public query; provenance of the executed reads.                   |
| Platform env          | Quoted/shorthand return keys, imported helpers, equivalent imports.                                | Swapped or fabricated URLs, redeclared platform variables, fake/raw env reads, hardcoded app name.                                                      | Exact deployment addresses, generated platform types, and live app-name round trips; provenance independent of return syntax.        |
| Bounded listing       | Existing aliases/helpers plus bounded point re-fetches.                                            | Unbounded reads, collecting all pages, slicing after an unbounded read, disconnected bounded calls, cross-workspace rows.                               | Consumed native read bounds and real returned documents. Do not reject harmless SDK operations simply because the mock omitted them. |
| Cascade delete        | Different iteration/parallelization and error wording; the chosen missing-user contract.           | Orphaned cross-post comments/likes, deletion of another user's unrelated data, changed data on a rejected request.                                      | A dependency graph covering both direct authorship and ownership through posts; complete remaining documents.                        |

Execution should handle syntax and helper indirection naturally where feasible,
but a sandbox/mock is not automatically a complete solution. Keep real-backend
tests, add supported-operation regressions, and state that representative probes
do not establish correctness for every possible input or branch. Do not replace
these concrete checks with an AI pass/fail judgment.

## Supplied-context issues

- Standard `no_guidelines` generation omits guidance and research tools; code is
  scored without a repair loop. Interpret its API failures under those conditions,
  not as a verdict on a documentation-assisted coding workflow.
- The generic backend prompt requests Convex `^1.44.0`, while the seven reviewed
  selection tasks request exactly `1.41.0`. The task's specific requirement is
  reasonably controlling, but the contradictory instructions should be removed.
- The generic prompt always requests `tsconfig.json`, while heartbeat and cascade
  tasks give narrower exclusive file lists. Make task-specific file/version
  requirements authoritative in prompt generation. This is a separate input
  cleanup, not an established cause of Astra's invented env API.
- `006-typed_env` and `009-platform_env_urls` share setup but have distinguishable
  claims: application validators/defaults versus built-in platform addresses.
  Keep both only with those distinct assertions. Shared setup alone is not a
  reason to merge them, nor should it be mistaken for independent evidence of
  two unrelated capability failures.
- Selection results should remain distinguishable from behavioral correctness
  in reports and future score presentation. This review does not change their
  weighting or excuse failed component-selection checks.

## Order of work

1. Completed: replace nested-limit source matching with executed native-call
   inspection and retain real-backend rollback checks. See the validation report.
2. Typed application env grading is corrected. Review the local platform env
   correction, which retains its distinct platform-URL and raw-read requirements.
3. Review the proposed time-window and missing-user contract clarifications,
   then add the cascade dependency-graph cases. Do not silently rewrite past
   task interpretations.
4. Repair bounded point-read support under the already agreed selection claim.
5. Resolve generic prompt/file/version conflicts and review how selection scores
   are presented, separately from changing individual task scores.

Keep these as separate reviewable changes. A changed task claim belongs to a new
benchmark version once the batch is ready and minting is explicitly approved.

## Evidence and limits

Current task text, grader source, reference answers, the actual prompt renderer,
and the original six saved Astra run records were inspected. Earlier unchanged
regression suites were reviewed from their reports; they were not all rerun.
No fresh model generation or production reporting was needed for this review.

- Existing validator review: [validator-composition-eval-proposals.md](validator-composition-eval-proposals.md).
- Existing heartbeat review: [local_heartbeat_isolation_2026-09-08.md](../reports/openai/gpt-6-astra/local_heartbeat_isolation_2026-09-08.md).
- Existing native-limit false positive: `/tmp/astra-audit/nested-limit-root-probe/results.json` (all stages and 8/8 tests pass).
- Existing platform-env counterexamples: `/tmp/astra-audit/platform-env-probes/results.json` (reference 5/5, helper and quoted keys 4/5, all three Astra answers fail deployment).
- New typed-env/cascade cases: `/tmp/astra-audit/contract-probes/results.json` (references 100%, fake env 4/4, idempotent delete 3/4).
- New bounded re-fetch cases: `/tmp/astra-audit/bounded-refetch-contract-probe/results.json` (reference 6/6, valid re-fetch 5/6).
- New incomplete cascade case: `/tmp/astra-audit/cascade-cross-edge-probe/results.json` (the implementation omitting direct authored dependencies still scores 4/4).

All scoring probes used disposable local backends and
`DISABLE_CONVEX_REPORTING=1`. AI grading remains disabled in
`grader/aiGrader.ts`. The scope is the reviewed tasks and demonstrated cases,
not a certificate that the entire benchmark has no defects.
