Create a schema file for a table called `example` that
has two tables. The first table is called `users` and
contains the following fields:
- name: string
- email_addresses: string[]

The second table is called `posts` and has:
- title: string
- author: Id<"users">
- content: string

Only create the `package.json` and `convex/schema.ts` files. Do NOT create any functions.
