Create a backend that demonstrates code reuse patterns in Convex by implementing functions to read users and posts.

Required files:
- convex/schema.ts
- convex/users.ts
- convex/posts.ts

Schema should define:
```ts
users: {
  name: string,
  email: string
}
posts: {
  userId: Id<"users">,
  content: string
}
```
With only an index on posts `by_user` and users `by_email`.

Implement these functions:

1. In convex/users.ts:
   - Create an internal query `getUserByEmail` that:
     - Takes email (string) as argument
     - Returns the user document or null

2. In convex/posts.ts:
   - Create an internal query `getPostsByUserId` that:
     - Takes userId (Id<"users">) as argument
     - Returns array of post documents
   - Create a query `getUserAndPosts` that:
     - Takes an argument of an email.
     - Fetches the user and their posts
     - Returns an object with the user and their posts

Don't specify returns validators for query/mutations.
Create any helper functions you need to avoid duplicating code.
DO NOT duplicate the code between `getUserByEmail`, `getPostsByUserId`, and `getUserAndPosts`.
The data fetched should be transactionally consistent.
Avoid creating subtransactions when possible, for efficiency.
