Create a backend that demonstrates different types of Convex functions with varying visibility and access patterns.

Implement these functions in `convex/index.ts`:

1. Create a query `getPublicStats` that:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Returns a static object containing { totalUsers: 100, version: "1.0.0" }
   - Should be accessible to client applications

2. Create a mutation `logClientEvent` that:
   - Takes eventName (string) and data (any) as arguments
   - Logs the event to the console
   - Returns the current timestamp
   - Should be accessible to client applications

3. Create an action `dailyCleanup` that:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Is meant to be run from the dashboard
   - Logs "Running daily cleanup" to console
   - Does nothing else
   - Returns nothing
   - Should NOT be accessible to clients

4. Create a mutation `resetCounter` that:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Is meant to be called from CLI or scheduled asynchronously from another function
   - Does nothing but logs "Resetting counter" to console
   - Returns nothing
   - Should NOT be accessible to clients


Create only the `convex/index.ts` and `package.json` files. Do not generate any other files.
No schema is required since this demo doesn't use the database.
