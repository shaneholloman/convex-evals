Create a demo that demonstrates all the ways to call functions from other functions in Convex.

Start by implementing three internal callee functions in `convex/index.ts`:
- An internal query `calleeQuery` that takes x and y numbers and returns their sum
- An internal mutation `calleeMutation` that takes x and y numbers and returns their difference
- An internal action `calleeAction` that takes x and y numbers and returns their product

Then create two caller functions in `convex/index.ts`:

1. Create a mutation called `callerMutation` that demonstrates:
   - Calling the internal query with x=1 and y=2
   - Using the result to call the internal mutation with y=2
   - Return the final result

2. Create an action called `callerAction` that demonstrates:
   - Calling the internal query with x=1 and y=2
   - Using the result to call the internal mutation with y=2
   - Using that result to call the internal action with y=2
   - Return the final result
