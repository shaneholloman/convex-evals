Create a backend for a basic file storage system that demonstrates all core file operations in Convex.

Assume the following schema, and output it to `convex/schema.ts`:
```ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
    files: defineTable({
        storageId: v.id("_storage"),
    }),
})
```

1. Create a mutation `generateUploadUrl`:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Returns a string URL for file upload

2. Create a mutation `finishUpload`:
   - Takes a storage ID as an argument
   - Inserts a new record in the "files" table with the storage ID
   - Returns null

3. Create a query `getFileUrl`:
   - Takes a file ID as an argument
   - Retrieves the file record from the database, throwing an error if not found
   - Gets the download URL for the storage ID associated with the file.
   - Throws an error if the storage entry is not found
   - Returns the URL as a string

4. Create a query `getFileMetadata`:
   - Takes a file ID as an argument
   - Retrieves the file record and returns all of its system metadata
   - Throws an error if the file is not found

5. Create a mutation `deleteFile`:
   - Takes a file ID as an argument
   - Deletes both the storage object and database record
   - Throws an error if the file is not found

Implement ALL functions in `convex/index.ts`.
