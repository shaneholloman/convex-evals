Create a backend that demonstrates using database indexes efficiently while filtering on additional fields.

Write this schema to `convex/schema.ts`:
```ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    age: v.number(),
    isDeleted: v.boolean(),
  }).index("by_age", ["age"]),
});
```

Implement the following function in `convex/index.ts`:

1. Create a query `getActiveAdults` that:
   - Takes an age (number) as an argument
   - Uses the "by_age" index to efficiently query all users >= the given age
   - Filters out users where isDeleted is true
   - Returns an array of user names
   - Uses proper typing for the return value

The goal is to show how to apply additional filtering criteria on non-indexed fields

Make sure to use TypeScript types appropriately and include clear error handling if needed.
Only generate the `getActiveAdults` function in `convex/index.ts`. Do not generate any other functions.
Also generate the `package.json` and `convex/schema.ts` files.
