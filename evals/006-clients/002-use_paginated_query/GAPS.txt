clients, use_paginated_query:

- Neither knows what to do with the `usePaginatedQuery` hook.
- I added another line to task.txt asking to explicitly use it.
- Claude still struggling with <tags> output (App.tsx)
- covered by guideline: use `paginationOptsValidator` in args and return paginated shape fields (`page`, `isDone`, `continueCursor`).
